**BIOEN 3301 Computational Methods Project Proposal**  
*Patrick Pearson, Julie Tang, and Zach Zundel*

**Sponsoring faculty:** [Sarang Joshi](https://www.bioen.utah.edu/directory/profile.php?userID=252)

### Overview of Project
 - What real-world bioengineering problem will this project address?
 - Why is it an important problem? How can a computational method help solve the problem?
 - Is the anticipated level of effort appropriate for a term project?

### Computational Approach
 - What capability of MATLAB will be applied to the problem?
 - What built-in or user-defined functions will be needed?
 - What input and/or output capabilities will be utilized?
 - What will be the user interface?
 - Will plotting or printing be done?
 - Will data be generated? What is the estimated length of the program?

### Potential Difficulties
 - What are some potential difficulties that may arise as you pursue the project?
 - How might you overcome these?

### Outcome of Project
 - What will be the "deliverable" to the sponsor (i.e., plots, statistics, data, values, images, understanding, etc.)?
 The deliverable product will be a GUI application which streams images from a webcam and renders a three-dimensional object within the stream.
