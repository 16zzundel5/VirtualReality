### Overview of Project
 This project does not address a specific problem in healthcare but can address a multitude of problems. One problem it can
 address is it can help surgeon in while preforming  surgery by rendering a real time image of a tumor or body part. This is
 important because any little detail that helps surgeons maximize their probability of success will save lives. 
 Another potential problem this technology could be applied to is help motivate people to exercise. Appling the augmented 
 reality technology to games could help motivate people to exercise by allowing them to play a game simultaneously. This 
 can already be seen in the app 'Pokemon Go' which motivated people to walk around in order to find Pokemon. While we will 
 not be rendering a tumor or Pokemon in real time, the rendering of an object in real time is the fundamental behind it.
 While this itself isnt life savingly important, it can help people develop healthy habits. This project is no doubt enough 
 for a term project given its level of difficultly and its applicability to the real world. 

### Computational Approach
 - What capability of MATLAB will be applied to the problem?
 - What built-in or user-defined functions will be needed?
 - What input and/or output capabilities will be utilized?
 - What will be the user interface?
 - Will plotting or printing be done?
 - Will data be generated? What is the estimated length of the program?

### Potential Difficulties
 - What are some potential difficulties that may arise as you pursue the project and how might you overcome these?
   - Light source could be a problem for this project. Having too many light sources can make the 3D image look unreal because
     those same light sources would have to be placed onto the 3D object and it may look unreal if we cannot match the light and
     the shadows of the 3D object to the light source.
   - Making sure to have the right algorithms for ray calculations is important in order to render the 3D image.
     
### Outcome of Project
 - The outcome of the project will be a series of computer generated imagery overlayed on to real time camera 
 - images which will give the effect of augmented reality. T
