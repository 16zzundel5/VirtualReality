# Virtual Reality Renderer for MATLAB :fire:
BIOEN 3301 Computational Methods Project

Patrick Pearson, Julie Tang, Zach Zundel

## Abstract
Long confined the to the realm of science fiction, virtual reality has many applications across domains as disparate as video gaming and military operations. One of the core tasks associated with virtual reality is rendering a computer-generated image over a video stream such that it appears that the image is integrated with the rest of the stream. Our project will render objects in a video stream from a webcam and display the results.

Our MATLAB program will connect to a webcam and fetch images one at a time.
